### What is Monte Carlo simulation ?
A mathematical method called Monte Carlo Simulation, also referred to as the Monte Carlo Method or a multiple probability simulation, is used to predict the likely outcomes of an uncertain event.

When compared to a set of fixed input values, Monte Carlo Simulation predicts a set of outcomes based on an estimated range of values. In other words, for any variable that has inherent uncertainty, a Monte Carlo Simulation creates a model of potential results by utilising a probability distribution, such as a uniform or normal distribution. Then, using a new set of random numbers between the minimum and maximum values, it repeatedly calculates the results. This exercise can be repeated tens of thousands of times in a typical Monte Carlo experiment to generate a wide range of likely results.

# Monte Carlo Simulation in Machine Learning.

Numerous issues can be solved with a Monte Carlo simulation in almost every industry, including engineering, supply chain management, finance, and science. A simulation with multiple probabilities is another name for it.

The most important points to keep in mind while using Monte Carlo simulations are:

1. A Monte Carlo simulation is a model used to predict the probability of different outcomes when the intervention of random variables is present.
2. Monte Carlo simulations help to explain the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.
3. A variety of fields utilize Monte Carlo simulations, including finance, engineering, supply chain, and science.
4. The basis of a Monte Carlo simulation involves assigning multiple values to an uncertain variable to achieve multiple results and then averaging the results to obtain an estimate.
5. Monte Carlo simulations assume perfectly efficient markets.

# Problem 1 : Predicting probability of default of a company using ESG data.
Due to the small sample size and randomly distributed data, machine learning models are unable to accurately predict the relationship between the input variable and the target variable. As a result, we must perform Monte Carlo simulations and hyperparameter tuning. We have scrapped some ESG scores for a specific company.
